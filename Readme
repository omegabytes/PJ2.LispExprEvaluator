CSC220 Programming Project #2
=============================

Due Date: 23:55pm, Wednesday, 4/2/2014, upload LispExprEvaluator.java to ilearn

- You need to implement LispExprEvaluator.java which uses Java API Stack
  See project requirements in LispExprEvaluator.java

- Use TestLispExprEvaluator.java to test correctness of your program

- Compile programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):

  javac PJ2/*.java
  javac *.java

- Run programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):

  // Run main() method tests in LispExprEvaluator class
  java PJ2.LispExprEvaluator

  // Run main test program
  java TestLispExprEvaluator

- Bonus (20%): Implement GUI test program

  Talk to me before you start this part.
